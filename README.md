# SudokuCreator

Application that allows you to play and solve sudoku.
The program creates a board that allows user to play at various difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard.
During solving sudoku, user enters next numbers by clicking on the given field, and then pressing the numeric key on the keyboard.
The game recognizes incorrect number input and correct sudoku solution.

The program uses the algorithm with backtracking to solve sudoku.

I plan to introduce one more unusual feature in the future. The application will allow the user to upload a photo with the prepared sudoku, and then the program will analyze this photo by downloading the board. The program will then solve the given sudoku by itself and present the solution to the user
